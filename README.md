<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Translat3 is a community powered platform that can help you localize your product. Since it runs on Web3, translat3 has no global boundaries thus enabling native speakers to translate your projects accurately and at a cheaper rate. 

Translat3 has four functionalities

1. Add Project: This is used to add a project to the platform. Anyone can add project to the platform. User can write a short description and kickstart the project with a few funds.
2. Fund Project: After a project is added it can be funded by anybody in the community. 
3. Translate: Once a project has enough funds, it can be moved to Translation phase, here translators from the community can translate the project, paragraph by paragraph.
4. Vote: If a paragraph has a valid translation, it can be voted by the community.

#### How are rewards distributed?
Each paragraph is given a value. For now, this value is ```Total Funds / No of Paragraphs```. For each paragraph, the translator with valid translation is given 50% of the paragraph's value and the rest 50% is distributed among the rightful validators.
